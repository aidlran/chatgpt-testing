# ChatGPT Testing

This repo contains code I've generated while experimenting with the OpenAI [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) model.

ChatGPT will rarely generate exactly what you want on the first try, but by using the chat thread system, you can have it iterate on and hopefully improve the code according to your prompts. As such, I've used Git commits to show the diffs of each iteration while including in the comment the prompt I used and any additional documentation or explanation that the bot gave.

Hopefully other folks will find this thing as fascinating and exciting as I do. I encourage you to check out ChatGPT for yourself - it's super interesting and it can do much more than just write code!
